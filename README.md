# Battle Arena

This is a project which has been on my mind for sometime. It is an eSports/gaming tournament tracking platform which i am building to learn some concepts related to product engineering in general. This is the api-gateway. The other projects for this app can be found on my github profile.

## Technologies Used

Technologies used in this project are:

- Java
- Spring boot
- Spring Cloud Gateway
- Circuit breaker with Resilience4j

  (Technologies used will be updated here as and when added).

## Installation

First, clone this project using git, and navigate into the project folder:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/archdemon-developer/battle-arena-api-gateway.git
  cd battle-arena-api-gateway
```
Then use your favourite IDE to import the project, and start the server to run the Gateway! :)
